  name: Rawhide-based ELN + Buildroot Prototype 
  description: This is a prototype resolved against Rawhide repositories to help us figure out what to rebuild in ELN. You probably want to see the 'ELN Package Set + Buildroot' view.

  repository: repository-fedora-rawhide


  ###  Unwanted packages in ELN  ###
  #
  # The list has moved to the "unwanted-eln-packages.yml" file,
  # because that way we can have just one file included into all the
  # various ELN views.
  #
  # So please use "unwanted-eln-packages.yml" instead.
