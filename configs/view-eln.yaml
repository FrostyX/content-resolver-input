  # Simo Sorce: The packages added in this PR are unwanted either
  # because they are bad cryptography implementation, unmaintained,
  # or simply not certifiable or redundant (same functionality
  # already present in multiple crypto packages already and we do
  # not want to add more).

  - rubypick

  # Petr Viktorin:
  # Python 2.7 not maintained upstream, and marked as deprecated()
  # in Fedora.

  # Python 3.6 is quickly becoming obsolete, and might presumably
  # be pulled into a RHEL-like environment.

  # Radek Vykydal:
  # system-config-kickstart has been deprecated upstream, it has not
  # been ported to Python 3, and shouldn't have been included in RHEL 8.
  - system-config-kickstart
